# Showdown bots

These are submissions for the [Showdown](https://github.com/ewjoachim/showdown) game.

## Licence

I'm not in a position to licence the code, because it's not mine so all I can say is that everyone seemed okay that I would publish the code, and please don't sue me. Of course, PRs are accepted if need be.
